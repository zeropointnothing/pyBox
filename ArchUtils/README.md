# ArchUtils

A command line utility written in Python with multiple different commands.

### Setup

First, make the archutils file executable by running
```bash
chmod a+x ./archutils # assuming you are in the ArchUtils directory
```

Then, run the file with `./archutils`. It should automatically detect that it has not been set up, and will attempt to do so. If it is already in /home/USER/cpath, it will simply tell you where it is located.

Once ArchUtils has been placed in `cpath`, you should be able to run it by simply typing in `archutils -h`. If you don't see an output, try rebooting or restarting your terminal to process the new changes to `.bashrc`.
